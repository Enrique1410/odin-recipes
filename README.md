# odin-recipes

The Odin Project: Recipes
The current project is a basic recipe website, with the first 3 recipes added randomly.
The skills that I demonstrated in this project are, create and clone a repository from GitHub to local. Basic HTML concepts with boilerplate, heading, list, links and images. File arrangement and management. Push project to GitHub.
